# 🚀 Space 'Roids! #
**Spoiler Alert !!!** This project contains the source code for the game **'Roids** from the **Udemy** online course [**Exploring Game Mechanics with Python**](https://www.udemy.com/course/exploring-game-mechanics-with-python-and-pygame/). It's a really amazing first dive into Pygame and this is one of the fun remakes featured. If you're a developer it runs better with the intended ```800 x 800``` resolution.

> I recommend updating both vars ```screen_width``` and ```screen_height``` to 800 pixels before playing, even though it is not a requirement. You can obviously also tweak it to your liking.

There could be updates based on the Atari classic coming in the future tense. 🤖

## Requirements: ##

>You'll need to have the [**Python language**](https://www.python.org/) interpreter ( >3 ) installed  in your system to try it out. You also need to have the Pygame package installed ( I'm currently on version > 2.1.3 ). 

You can install the latest version of **Pygame** 🐍 by running ```"pip install pygame"``` at the prompt. If you clone or download this repo you can change to this folder after extracting the files and run ```"python space_roids.py"```.
